        <li><h2>Data : </h2></li>
        <p>
            The is Symbols or Signals that are input, store and  processed by a Computer, for output as useable Information.
        </p>
        <li><h2>Information : </h2></li>
        <p>
            Knowledge resulting from the processing of data and enable decision-making .
        </p>
        <li><h2>Database :</h2></li>
        <p>
            A database is a collection of data organized in a particular way.<br>
            # Databases can be of many types such as Flat File Databases, Relational Databases, and Distributed Databases etc.
        </p>
        <li><h2>Database Management System :</h2></li>
        <p>is a collection of interrelated data, and set of programs to access those data.<br>
        # The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise.<br>
        # The primary goal of a DBMS is to <span class="criti">provide away to store and retrieve database information</span> that is both convenient and effecient.
        <br># Management of data involves both <span class="criti">deﬁning structures for storage of information </span>and <span class="criti">providing mechanisms for the manipulation of information</span>.
        <br># In addition, the database system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <h2>Database System Applications:</h2>
    <h3>Databases are widely used. Here are some representative applications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Banking:</span> For customer information, accounts, and loans, and banking transactions.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Airlines:</span> For reservations and schedule information.</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Universities<span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Credit card transactions</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Telecommunication</span></p></li>
        <li><p><span class="criti">Finance</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Database Systems versus File Systems </h2>
    <h3>Keeping organizational information in a ﬁle processing system has a number of major disadvantages:</h3>
    <p>• Data redundancy and inconsistency.<br>• Difficulty in accessing data.<br>• Data isolation.<br>• Integrity problems.<br>• Atomicity problems.<br>• Concurrent-access anomalies.<br>• Security problems.</p>
    <h2>Components of the DBMS environment : </h2>
    <h3>(1) Hardware:</h3>
    <p>The computer system(s) that the DBMS and the application programs run on.</p>
    <h3>(2) Software:</h3>
    <p>The DBMS software with application programs ,together with the Operating system.</p>
    <h3>(3) Data:</h3>
    <p>acts as a bridge between the hardware and software components and the human components.</p>
    <h3>(4) Procedures:</h3>
    <p>The instructions and rules that govern the design and use of the database.</p>
    <h3>(5) People :</h3>
    <p>These include database designers , db adminstrators , programmers and end-users.</p>
