    <h2>Data Model </h2>
    <p class="def">An integrated collection of concepts for describing and manipulating data,relationships between data, and constraints on</p>
    <h3>A data model can be thought of as comprising three components:</h3>
    <p>(1) a structural part<br>(2) a manipulative part<br>(3) set of integrity constraints,<br><span class="criti">ensures that the data is accurate.</span> </p>
    <h3>Data models in the literature fall into three categories :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Object-based  (describe data at the conceptual and external levels).</li>
        <li>Record-based  (describe data at the conceptual and external levels).</li>
        <li>Physical data model (describe data at the internal level).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Object-Based Data Models : </h2>
    <p>■ Object-based data models use concepts such as <span class="criti">entities, attributes, and relationships</span>.</p>
    <p>■ <span class="criti">entity</span> is a distinct object (a person, place,thing, concept, event) in the organization that is to be represented in the database.</p>
    <p>■ <span class="criti">attribute</span> is a property that describes some aspect of the object that we wish to record.</p>
    <p>■ <span class="criti">relationship</span> is an association between entities.</p>
    <h3>Types of object-based data models : </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Entity–Relationship</li>
        <li>Semantic</li>
        <li>Functional</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Record-Based Data Models</h2>
    <p>...In a record-based model the database consists of a number of <span class="criti">ﬁxed-format records </span>possibly of differing types.<br> Each record type deﬁnes a ﬁxed number of ﬁelds.</p>
    <h3>Types of record based logical data model :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>relational data model.</li>
        <li>network data model.</li>
        <li>hierarchical data model.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Physical Data Models</h2>
    <p>-Physical data models describe how data is stored in the computer.<br>representing information such as record structures,record orderings, and access paths.</p>
    <p><span class="criti">* the most common Physical data models being are the unifying model frame.</span></p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>Three Schema</h2>
    <img src="schema.png" width="500">
    <h3>External or view level :</h3>
    <p>describes that part of the database that is relevant to each user.</p>
    <p>the external view includes only those entities,
        attributes, and relationships in the ‘real world’ that the user is interested in.</p>

    <h3>Conceptual level : </h3>
    <p>Describes where data is stored in the database and the relationships among them.</p>
    <p><span class="criti">This level contains the logical structure of the entire database as seen by the DBA.</span></p>
    <h3>The conceptual level represents :</h3>
    <p>■ all entities, their attributes, and their relationships;<br>
        ■ the constraints on the data;<br>
        ■ semantic information about the data.<br>
        ■ security and integrity information.</p>

    <h3>Internal level : </h3>
    <p>The physical representation of the database on the computer.<br>This level describes how the data is stored in the database.</p>
    <h3>The internal level is concerned with such things as :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>storage space allocation for data and indexes.</li>
        <li>record descriptions for storage.</li>
        <li>record placement.</li>
        <li>data compression and data encryption techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Schemas, Mappings, and Instances</h2>
    <p>The overall description of the database is called the <span class="criti">Database Schema</span>.</p>
    <p>The DBMS is responsible for mapping between these three types of schema.</p>
    <p>The conceptual schema is related to the internal schema through a conceptual/internal mapping.
        <br>■ This enables the DBMS to ﬁnd the actual record or
        combination of records in physical storage that
        constitute a logical record in the conceptual schema,
        together with any constraints to be enforced on the
        operations for that logical record. <br>■ It also allows any
        di erences in entity names, attribute names, attribute
        order, data types, and so on, to be resolved. Finally,
        each external schema is related to the conceptual
        schema by the external/conceptual mapping.<br>■ This
        enables the DBMS to map names in the user’s view
        on to the relevant part of the conceptual schema.</p>
    <img src="schema2.png" width="500">
    <p>-The data in the database at any particular point in time is called a<span class="criti"> database instance</span>.</p>
    <p>-The schema is sometimes called the <span class="criti">intension</span> of the database.<br>while an
        instance is called an <span class="criti">extension (or state)</span> of the database.</p>

    <h2>Data Independence</h2>
    <h3>Physical data independence :</h3>
    <p>refers to the immunity
        of the conceptual schema to changes in the internal schema.</p>

    <hr>
    <h1>DBMS Languages</h1>
    <p>A data <span class="criti">Sublanguage</span> consists of two parts :</p>
    <p>1) Data Deﬁnition Language (DDL),,specify the database</p>
    <p>2) Data Manipulation Language (DML),,used to both read and update the database.</p>
    <h2>
        DML
    </h2>
    <p class="def">A language that provides a set of operations to support the basic data manipulation operations on the data held in database.</p>

    <h3>Types of DML :</h3>
    <p>1\ Procedural DML.          2\ non-Procedural DML.</p>
    <h3>Q) What is The difference between Procedural and non-Procedural DML :</h3>
    <p>A) 1-procedural languages specify how the output of a DML statement is to be obtained, while nonprocedural DMLs describe only what output is to be obtained.<br>2-Typically,
        procedural languages treat records individually, whereas nonprocedural languages operate on sets of records.</p>

    <h2>Procedural DML :</h2>
    <p class="def">A language that allows the user to tell the system what data is needed and exactly how to retrieve the data.</p>
    <h2>non-Procedural DML :</h2>
    <p class="def">A language that allows the user to state what data is needed rather than how it is to be retrieved</p>
